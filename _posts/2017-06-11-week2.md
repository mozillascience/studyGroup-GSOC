The statistics would be displayed using [C3.js](http://c3js.org/) a chart library. This week, we decided on the types of graph to be used. Fetching the appropriate data and converting into JSON data for ease of access. We plotted 3 graphs: 1) Study Group Leaders vs Number of events
2) Types of Lessons taken by Study Group vs Number of lessons conducted 3) percentage of Levels of lessons (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
We retrieved the data from [Study Group Lessons](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons/issues)
