After lot of googling, I found how to auto push in github repository (username and password are not required). When we clone a git repository, there are two link options i.e, https and ssh. clone the "ssh" link. We can push the data using a [script](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io/tree/master/scripts). I have also modified the existing [codes](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io/tree/master/code) and uploaded in the repository.

Apparently, the [script](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events/blob/master/index.js) doesn't publish titles to the excel sheet. As per Hassen's amazing techie guide! We made some changes to the code.

[PR#11](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events/pull/11) Added title to the Excel Sheet
