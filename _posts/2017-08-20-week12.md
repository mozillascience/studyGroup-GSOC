This is the last week of Google Summer of Code 2017! The final Evaluation starts from 21st August, 2017. This week, I had to look for solution to run the cront job on cloud. [Cloud9](https://community.c9.io/) is an excellent space to share your workspace. Unfortunately, they don't support cront job. There are other cloud platform that provides various functionalities though priced. Apparently, the cront job is running in my VMWare. Hence, we can run the scripts once in a week. I have uploaded all the codes in [github directory](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io).  
<br/>
I have also updated the Dashboard [README.md](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io/blob/master/README.md) as well as sg-event [README.md](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events/pull/11/commits/22799df08d440fe563d73dff28b3290b88acdbf3) , and added a link to [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RjTk19ca851y9x4e2hUgPTRWOzEH5y6dffpMxuj9NrQ/edit) in the [Dashboard](http://anamikad.github.io/).
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank [Aurelia](https://github.com/auremoser) for being an amazing mentor! This GSoC is possible only because of her support! 
I would continue to work with her!
<br/>
<br/>
Future Work:
<br/>
1) The script to fetch Study Group [Events](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events/blob/master/index.js) and [Members](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io/tree/master/code/sg-members) are different. We can merge the scripts.
<br/>
2) There are good scope to improve our dashboard i.e, adding number of forks per month and Machine Learning techniques.
<br/>
3) [Mozilla Study Group Events](https://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupEvents/) can have a improved UI and multiple Features like news feed.
<br/>
4) The [cront jobs](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io/tree/master/scripts) can be migrated on cloud.
