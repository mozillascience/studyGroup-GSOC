This week, I added a feature that can display a study group event number by typing a Study Group name and the search query displays it. From the data collection, there is [whereweare.geojson](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC/blob/master/data/whereweare.geojson) that contains country location with study group details (not all the study group has location details). I fetched the number of study groups in respective countries and plotted a "spline" graph. The dashboard is ready to merge with [Study Group Event](https://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupEvents/).
