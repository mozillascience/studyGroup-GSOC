This week has been an hectic week due to my Convocation!! Finally our Study Group [Dashboard](https://anamikad.github.io/) is live! Soon, we will migrate this to Mozilla's repo. We have made a google doc to take [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4YtwmQMJo6w1EUKyBgxXjTy3ImCuhjx2GTn-xXw1DVFUQYg/viewform?c=0&w=1&includes_info_params=true). I am glad that [Rahul](https://gitter.im/rahulkrishnan98) and [Hassen](https://gitter.im/HassenPy) made [PRs](https://github.com/AnamikaD/AnamikaD.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) !
<br/>
We need to brainstorm on:
1) Automation: How can we automate the data updates
<br/>
2) Report generation: Generate a report using Data Analytics or Machine Learning
