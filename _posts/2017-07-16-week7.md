We went through Dashboard review, and it is time that we have all the events of our study group at one place i.e, [Mozilla Study Group Events](https://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupEvents/). It took bit of time to think over collection of data. Thanks to [Hassen](https://gitter.im/HassenPy) for the script! I had to add titles to the [excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBP7CnFS7tl1lvSZtZ9X-Wy9UdfHOCjwKKHt-mf8Po0/pubhtml). After modification of the code base, we are able to fetch all the Study Group Events. Though, code clean up needs to be done.
