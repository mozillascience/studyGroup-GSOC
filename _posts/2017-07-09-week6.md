This week, I had to write an sg script to collect number of [members](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/_data/members.yml) in a Study Group. This script was written with the help sg-event [script](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events/blob/master/index.js). Unfortunately, the script couldn't collect all the Study Group's members i.e, there was an issue in accessing few Study Group. Though, an area graph have been plotted with collected data. I have updated the [doc](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC/blob/master/SGE_Dashboard_Data.txt) to display a working model.
